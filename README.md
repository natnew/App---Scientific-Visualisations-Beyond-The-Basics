# App-Scientific-Visualisations-Beyond-The-Basics

A [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io) demo [written in pure Python](https://github.com/streamlit/demo-uber-nyc-pickups/blob/main/streamlit_app.py) to interactively visualize Space data.

The data visualisations in this app aim to give you an insight into how space can improve life on Earth. We will use the interactive [Plotly Library](https://plotly.com/python/) due to its seamless integration with many applications and beautiful visualisations. "
